Prevention is better than cure- In the era of technology, mobile applications have taken a major place in people’s life. 
It can help people do various things including save someone’s life. People tend to suffer or sometimes even die from certain diseases
which could easily be cured if those were known beforehand. This inspired us to build a mobile application that helps people predict 
illness based on the provided symptoms.

In this application, the user can sign up and login later to enter symptoms and check the predicted disease to help take further steps 
to cure the disease.This has been developed as a mobile application using Android studio with java as the programming language and 
SQLite as the database to store user information and symptoms of diseases.
